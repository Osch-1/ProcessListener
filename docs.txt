How to use process_listener.ps1

1. Define name of your process_listener
   For example: if you testing out SampleProcess project, the name will match with .exe file
   So it will be SampleProcess
2. Run ps1 script in the next way: process_listener.ps1 $ProcessName, where $ProcessName - process you want to listen to and stop pc(localhost) on it's termination

Behaviour:
  If process with $ProcessName doesn't exist on script execution time you will see notification about this situation
  Othrwise it will in cyclically try to get-process and if on some step it won't be found pc(localhost) will be stopped
